<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Applying for jobs is not fun and can be daunting. Sometimes, we forget when our next interview phone call will be or where we are in the interview stages. Mobi is an all in job tracking system to help you manage all your prospective jobs you are applying too.</p>

<p> Update: Update each input to help you keep better track all your active job prospects</p>
